 # Previous NHS MedicalPhysics work
An example of projects I carried out when I was working in the NHS. Includes folders with the following material:

* interesting clinical physics project reports primarily in medical imaging(MRI) and radiotherapy. 
* Conference abstracts/presentations
* Data analysis/Computational work in Matlab

Where patient data is used all identifiers/names etc have been anonymised in accordance with the Data Protection Act and Information Governance laws
